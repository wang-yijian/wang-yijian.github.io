                <b>About the Company</b><br>
                apple.com, operated by Apple, Inc., commonly known as Apple is an international online store that generates eCommerce sales mainly in the United States of America as well as in Greater China and Japan. With respect to the product variety, apple specializes in the “Electronics and Media” domain, especially in the category of “Consumer Electronics”. The online store was launched in 1997.
                Apple is the second largest information technology company by revenue (totaling $274.5 billion in 2020) behind Microsoft.
                <br> Visit official website: <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>      
                <br><br><b>Features of apple.com E-Commerce Portal</b><br>
                Apple's application is simplistic and easy to use. Searching is also very efficient.
                There are numerous apple products like Macbook, iphones, ipads, airpods, watch , TVs and other accessories, available to choose from and too without a mediator. The brand is known for its quality.
                The feature that I like the most is the bag option which is similar to 'add to cart' available on other stores. One can easily add, remove items to the bag or save the bag for later purchase. In COVID days Apple store played a very important role in people's lives
                as people were unable to move out of their homes and home delivery of products helped them follow COVID norms. There are student discounts which make it easier for students to buy apple products.
                <br><br><b>Things that can be improved</b><br>
                There is a huge price difference between apple products and products of other companies providing same features.
                Though apple is a trusted brand and comes with a long warranty, still expensive products make it difficult for students and other professionals to compromise between apple and other brands.
                Sometimes people also take advantage of price drop during site maintenance.
                Technical glitches are common in the mobile application and the web application mainly due to the heavy UI displayed on the portal. Most apple products show incompatibilty with other devices.
